Auto Scalling:
--------------

eg: Amazon sale when they have offers client will increase obveacilly we     need to increase server
   on demand can increase the server, on demand can decrease the server.

For this need to Launch Configuration.

eg: cpu utilization above 90 add server. cpu utilization below 50 remover server.

creating server by image.


on demand we can add or remove servers based on certain metrices
eg:disk rides

For Configuring we need couple of steps:

step 1:

-- we should do launch configuration
-- its a template that your auto scalling group will be used to launch    instances
-- template equals Ec2 + Webserver+ Application code.


step 2:

-- creating of template can be done like this launch Ec2 install web server -- on Ec2 followed by deploy our code on Ec2
   then create amazon image.
-- They ask for auto scalling to launch a new instances.
   images can be fine AMI's under IMAGES

Note:
we can use 750 hrs is free for month. to use the resources.
sudo chkconfig httpd on// during reboot m/c restart the webservers.
Minimus 2 servers
