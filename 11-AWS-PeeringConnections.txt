Peering Connections
*******************
-- Is Used to enstablish network communication between two VPCs.
-- Enables to connect multiple VPC into a single N/w.
-- VPCs can be same or different AWS accounts.
-- For VPC peering, both must be in same region.
-- For peering VPCs across different regions we can go with vpn or direct connect.
-- Trasitive Peering not supporting.
    VPC 1 -- VPC2 -- VPC3
    VPC1 peering VPC2
    VPC2 peering VPC3
  but we can not communicate VPC1 instances with VPC3 instance again we need direct connection.

NOTE: CIDER notation should be different. i.e should not have same ip address in both VPCs

DEMO:

steps:
1) Need two VPCs.
2) Atlease need 1 subnet in both VPCs
3) Create Peering Connections
    peering-demo
   Local VPC - give your VPC
   VPC (Accelator) -  give another VPC.
4) Goto action accept the Request.
5) Modify routhing tables in both VPCs.
     target should be vpc peering connection.
    Destination is IP address of your laptop
     VPC CIDER 10.0.0.0/16
 
-- you can peer connection only subnets also.

what are the diff ways to access vpc?
1) Create ec2 with public ip and attach internet.
2) VPN- Virtual Private N/W
3) Direct Connect- wired connection
