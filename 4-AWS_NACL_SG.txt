SG:(Security Groups)
----------------------------
-- one kind of firewall
-- SG for EC2 instance level .
-- Every EC2 instance must be associate with altlease security group.
-- Max 5 SG/ENI(Elastic network interface) can attach to ec2 instance.
-- Multiple instance can have same SG.
-- Every SG have one inbound rule(traffic going to ec2) & outbound (traffice going from ec2) rule. 
-- Security Groups acts lika a virtual firewall for you EC2 instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.
-- Security Group is State full. same inbound rules are applay to outbound.it will not check outbound rules.
-- Modification to the SG rule take effect immediately.
-- SG does not have explicit Allow/deny.
-- If you allow SSH traffic other traffic are implicity denied.
-- SG Source options 
     who can do ssh
           -- My IP
           -- Custom -- company range/ - mention CIDER of perticular network./ SG as source.
                ::/0 - IPV6 notation
                 ec2 instanche have sg can access.
                 where:
                  Webservers
                  LB --- WS1 -WS2 -WS3   -- DB(webserver acces this db.) the security group of DB can be use securit group of Webservers.
                   In Webserver SG can LB security group so only LB will have access.
              To Specify IP address 10.20.20.1/32
           -- AnyWhere
  Traffic nothing but a request.
  Traffic is initiated by a machine ec2.
  Traffic initated from internet.
  when you send the requst goes to Network ACL and then Security Group and then EC2

Custom TCP - To customize port eg: httpd by default run on 80 to change this to 88.
                         select Inbound rules and change the port Range.



In Ec2 
---------
3 layers of securities.
1)  id password of your ec2 inst
2)  sg
3)  NACL


all public ec2 instance will get internet.
but what about private ec2 instance to the get internet for some reasons like security updates, every day patching...

Demo:

1) create ec2 instance
2) start the machine
3) access the ec2 from terminal.
4) goto security group check inbound rules and outbound rules.
5) remove the outbound rules.

test: 
ping ip address if you still get response.i.e state full. this is from your laptop i.e internet.
ping google.com ping from your instance not get response i.e state less.

NOTE: All Network related resource under VPC.

NACL(Network Access Control List)
NACL:
--------
-- one kind of virtual firewall.
-- NACL for subnet level firewall.
-- A NACL  is implicity created at the time of creating VPC,this NACL is called as default NACL.
-- When a subnet is created, it is implicitly attached to default NACL.
-- Rules of default NACL
    -- Default rules allow all inbound and outbound.
-- NACL has explicity Allow and Deny
-- NACL is state less.
-- Changes to NACL rules take effect immediately.
-- NACL acts like a virtual firewall for your subnet to control inbound & outbound traffic.
-- One subnet can have only one NACL. can not have 2 NACL for a subnet.
-- Same NACL can be associated with multiple subnets.


Rules of Default NACL: 
------------------------------
-- it accepts all inbound and it allows all outbounds.on top of that we can add retrictions on i/b and o/b traffics.

NACL support:
-- have separate rule for inbound.i.e we can control i/b, by adding rules
   i can say allow this, 
   i can say deny this.
   i can block ip address 
-- have separate rule for outbound.i.e we can control o/b

-- NACL is statless.
-- Incase of SG is statfull i.e there is i/b rule that rule remeber what    is going out.
-- it will remeber what is going out and what is coming in.


-- Incase of subnet,    we can control i/b but there is no control on    o/b.
-- we can control what is coming in.
-- but we cannot control what is going out.
-- we cannot block ip address.
-- subnet can have only one NACL at a time.
-- Subnet associate with only one NACL.
-- Incase of Security Groups, Ec2 can have more than one SG's @ a time.

Rules:
Rule 1 Type   Protocal  Port storage source Allow/deny
1                                                                     Deny
2                                                                     ALLOW

How the rules are evaluated:
-- it starts from the lowest number.
  eg: 1 rule says Deny
        2 rule says ALLOW
-- whenever request comes in it will evaluate lowest number rule so here 1 is lowest rule then it will deny.
-- And it will not evaluate next rule. eventhogh there is rule to allow.

-- The evaluation of rules happen from smallest number to highest number.
-- we can control inbound and outbound as well.
-- source can be ip,subnet.

The best partice to give a number to rule
100,200,300.....etc. in hundreds the reason is we will a scope to put rule b/w 100 and 200.
1 and 2 to put rule its not possible.

DEMO:
In Default NACL,

Add Rule
50 ALL trafif      source ip addres DENY
