Routing Policys:


simple
wightage
latancy:

latancy for region 1 150 ms and region 2 100ms 
this policys routs to region 2


failover:
this policy ment for disaster recovery.

Geolocation:

based on cliens geographical location the traffic routed a specific region.


S3(simple storage service):

-- object based storage
-- Object can be file,video,pdf,...etc.
-- one object size can be 5TB. If more than split object and store.
-- supports server side encryption of data
-- when data transfer in network should encrypt and when store data encryption
-- Supports REST & SOAP APIs
-- s3 is highly scalable.
-- we can store unlimited data.no need to mention the capacity how much GB required
-- No need to specify the size.

S3 use cases:

-- Backups & Recovery
-- eg: database backups,ebs backups,log backups.
-- Big data analytics.
-- Data archiving.

Keys:
Key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket.Every object in a bucket has exactly one key.

Regions:
You can choose the geographical region where amazon s3 will store the buckets you create.
You might choose a region to optimize 

S3 Storage Classes
 Standard
     99.99% availability
-- 99.99999999999 Durability - the percent of loosing data very less.

Standard - Infrequently Accessed
Same as Standard but storage cost is less.

Reduced Redundancy
 Durability low.
