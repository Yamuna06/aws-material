what is Virtualization?
why need Virtualization?

Server configuration:
UNIX/25CPU/32GBRAM/124HDD

Networking Cloud:

-- Amazon Provides VPC(Virtual Private Cloud)
-- VPC enables to setup Virtual Private N/w in cloud

Navigation:
-----------
Services-->Networking-->VPC
-- Dedicated Host.
--Isolation-- Sapareation

Create VPC:
-------------
Click -->VPC --> Your VPCs -->Create VPCs

192.168.0.0/16
192.168-- Reprasents your VPC n/w 16-bit
192.168.1-- subnet n/w portion 24-bit
192.168.1.0 -- host one.  32 bit

-- VPC is region Specific.

NOTE: we can combine VPCs 
Lets say one VPC Tokya and onther VPC in Mumbain we can connect with help of Peering Connections.

Create Subnet:
--------------
subnet --> 

EC2:(Elastic Compute Cloud)
---------------------------
i.e VM
-- It is a virtual m/c in the cloud which has cpu,ram,hard disk and networking capabilities.

-- In cloud We need EC2 Instance on top of it we want to install
webserver to host our static website

Choose an Amazon Machine Image(AMI):
-------------------------------------
AMI is a template that contains the s/w configuration (operating system,application server, and applications) required 
to launch your instance.

1)Choose Instance Type:
   EC2 get 72hrs get free. for month.
2) Configure Instance
3) Add Storage(Hard Disk-HDD):
4) Add Tags: Used for Billing
5) Configure Security Group:  Configuring the firewall
 --is a set of rules that control the traffic for your instance.

Note: Every Ec2 must have one security group.can have multiple also.

How to specify IP address? 
---------------------------
-- which is best practice Custom to specify the Source in SG.
   Dont put anywhere(0.0.0.0/0,::/0) as a source in realtime.

-- password key pair more secured than private password.
-- we want to login to Ec2 instance from our laptop
   the problem is VPC in diff n/w our laptop is in diff n/w

-- To fix this problem 3 option

 1) can communicate with help of i/n
 2) can use VPN connection
 3) can use direct connect. LAN connection to VPC.

-- Our laptop should have intenet connection
-- our VPC & it Ec2 instance must have internet access.
-- Create Internet gateway and attach to VPC.

Internet Gateway:
------------------
-- when we create I/G by default it is not associated with VPC.
-- Can we attach morethan one i/g to single VPC?
-- Giving the access at datacenter level

Protecting accidental termination of EC2 instance
---------------------------------------------------------------

-- This protection can be enables while launching or even after instance is launched.

DEMO:

while creating Ec2 instance - in - Configuration details 

Enable termination projection : select project against option
another way,

In Actions, Instance Setting --change shutdown behaviour

Ec2 - User Data
--------------------
Using user data we can run certain scripts(shell/pytho/ruby) at the time of lanunching ec2 instance.

Demo:

In step 3 , Advance details, User data
we can upload file and copy paste the script

sample script:
#! /bin/bash  //This tell your shell or OS
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
echo "<h1> welcome to AWS </h1>" > /var/www/html/one.html   // > = redirecting

Note: user data 

Ec2 logs location:
---------------------
cd /var/log/
ls // list the files
cloud-init-output.log // can see output to troubleshoot the issues.
